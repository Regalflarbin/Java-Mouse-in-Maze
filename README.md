# Java-Mouse-in-Maze
First java project where a mouse has to navigate a maze. The maze exectuable should be started first, then the mouse. The mouse executable i nthis repository should mainly be used as reference, as it is not the final product. The final submission mouse exe seems to have been lost somewhere.
